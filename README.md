# BIOMETRIC-DATA-PROTECTION
The use of biometric information like fingerprints, face recognition, and iris scans has grown dramatically as a result of the exponential growth in digital transactions and identity verification systems. Because biometrics are distinct and hard to fake, they have emerged as a key component of safe authentication. But there are serious drawbacks to this reliance, such as privacy issues, data breaches, and illegal access. Biometric data is susceptible to misuse and cyberattacks because traditional security solutions frequently lack strong safeguards. Advanced security measures must be developed since biometric data is unchangeable, unlike passwords or PINs, and any compromise might have permanent repercussions. Steganography and encryption offer powerful tools to enhance the security of sensitive data. Encryption ensures the confidentiality of information by converting it into an unreadable format, while steganography conceals the existence of the data itself. QR codes, widely used for information sharing due to their compactness and versatility, provide an ideal medium for embedding encrypted biometric data. By integrating these techniques, the proposed system addresses existing vulnerabilities in biometric data protection. This layered approach ensures that even if the QR code is intercepted, the encrypted data within remains inaccessible without the proper decryption key, providing a comprehensive and resilient solution to modern security challenges.
